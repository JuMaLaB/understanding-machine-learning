Value prediction | Identify clusters of like data
Needs training data containingvalue being predicted | Data does not contain cluster membership
Trained model predicts value in new data | Model provides access to data by cluster

# ML workflow
- asking the right question
- preparing data
- selecting algorithm
- training the model
- testing the model

# ML Guidelines
1. Early steps are most important (Each step depends on previous steps)
2. Expect to go backwards (Later knowledge effects previous steps)
3. Data is never as you need it (Data will have to be altered)
4. More data is better (More Data => Better Results)
5. Think before acting (Understand results before changing data or model)
6. Donâ€™t pursue a bad solution (Reevaluate, fix or quit)
